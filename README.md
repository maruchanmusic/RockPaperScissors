This is my first JavaScript project â€” a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game played in the console.

The last function, playGame, was quite challenging for me, but working through it helped me gain confidence in JavaScript.
How to play

    Run the program in a JavaScript-enabled environment (like your browser console).

    You will be prompted to choose rock, paper, or scissors.

    The computer will make a choice.

    The game plays 5 rounds and shows the final score and winner.
